# GAS Trip Automatization

### ⚠️⚠️ WIP Project! Please be patient and report if you encounter any bugs

This is a standalone script (that consists of multiple files). The purpose is to detect Gmail automatic calendar events related with trips and create the consecuent events on Google Calendar automatically.

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here](https://script.google.com/d/1BOk8MDLbLaHh6SwG1M1tsgNXjkcC-79LE0QoipRuTDxbO3fMVvqoROQD/edit?newcopy=true)

**To make a copy in the new Google Apps Script interface:**

1. Go to the project overview icon on the left (looks like this: ⓘ)
2. Click the "copy" icon on the top right (looks like two files on top of each other)
